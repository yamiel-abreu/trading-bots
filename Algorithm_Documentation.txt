Both bots (the EMA/MACD/RSI bot and the EMA/Stochastic bot) are designed to generate alerts only (not auto-trades). These alerts are based on common swing-trading setups for 1H/4H timeframes.

📊 Bot 1: EMA + MACD + RSI Strategy
Indicators Used:

EMA(50) and EMA(200) → to filter trend (classic “Golden Cross / Death Cross” logic).

MACD (12, 26, 9) → momentum confirmation.

RSI(14) → to avoid overbought/oversold traps.

Rules:
🔹 Long Entry (Buy Signal)

Trend: 50 EMA > 200 EMA (uptrend).

MACD: MACD line crosses above signal line (bullish momentum).

RSI: > 50 (bullish zone, not oversold).


➡️ Bot sends: “Long signal on [Ticker]”

🔹 Short Entry (Sell Signal)

Trend: 50 EMA < 200 EMA (downtrend).

MACD: MACD line crosses below signal line (bearish momentum).

RSI: < 50 (bearish zone, not overbought).

➡️ Bot sends: “Short signal on [Ticker]”


📊 Bot 2: EMA + Stochastic Strategy
Indicators Used:

EMA(50) and EMA(200) → trend filter.

Stochastic (14, 3, 3) → entry timing (overbought/oversold crosses).

RSI(14) → optional extra filter.

Rules:
🔹 Long Entry (Buy Signal)

Trend: 50 EMA > 200 EMA (uptrend).

Stochastic: %K line crosses above %D line below 20 (oversold reversal).

RSI: Ideally > 50, but main trigger is Stochastic.

➡️ Bot sends: “Long signal on [Ticker]”

🔹 Short Entry (Sell Signal)

Trend: 50 EMA < 200 EMA (downtrend).

Stochastic: %K crosses below %D above 80 (overbought reversal).

RSI: Ideally < 50, but main trigger is Stochastic.

➡️ Bot sends: “Short signal on [Ticker]”



✅ Key Difference Between the Bots

Bot 1 (MACD/RSI) → looks for trend continuation signals (when momentum aligns with trend).

Bot 2 (Stochastic) → looks for pullback/reversal entries within the larger trend.

In practice:

Bot 1 gives fewer, stronger “trend-following” signals.

Bot 2 gives more frequent “buy dips / sell rallies” signals.

⚡ Example:
If EURUSD is trending up (50 EMA > 200 EMA):

Bot 1 alerts when momentum kicks back in (MACD bullish cross + RSI > 50).

Bot 2 alerts when the market dips into oversold (Stochastic < 20) and starts turning back up.
